vtcp - a TCP port multiplexing layer
------------------------------------

vtcp allows you to pass TCP traffic from multiple applications though a single
TCP port. Note that vtcp is not a tunelling solution: vtcp deamon server only
as a rendez-vous point, the TCP traffic itself is passed directly between
applications, vtcp deamon is not involved in any way.

To use vtcp:

1. Start the vtcp deamon. Specify the port you want to multiplex:

    $ ./vtcpd 5555

2. On the server side Bind socket to a subport, then accept new connections:

    int listener = vtcp_bind (5555, 10);
    ...
    int fd = vtcp_accept (listener);

3. On the client side, connect to the subport:

    int fd = vtcp_connect (inet_addr ("127.0.0.1"), 5555, 10);
